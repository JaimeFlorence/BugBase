I'm continuing work on "The BugBase" bug tracking system. The project is located at `/home/jaime/MyCode/src/BugBase/`.

## Current Status:
- Completed initial planning and brainstorming
- Created documentation files (PLANNING.md, TASK.md, DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Initialized project structure with backend and frontend directories
- Set up backend with Node.js, TypeScript, and all dependencies
- Created comprehensive Prisma schema with all models
- Docker Compose configured for PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO

## Tech Stack:
- Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Redis
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Infrastructure: Docker, Socket.io for real-time

## Next Steps:
1. Create backend directory structure (src/controllers, services, middleware, etc.)
2. Implement authentication system with JWT
3. Create base API structure and error handling
4. Set up database migrations and seed data
5. Initialize frontend React project with Vite
6. Implement core bug CRUD operations

## Key Files to Reference:
- `/backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete database schema
- `/PLANNING.md` - Architecture and feature details
- `/TASK.md` - Detailed task list and progress
- `/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide

Please review the TASK.md file to see what's been completed and continue with the next pending tasks.

When I say "wrap it up" or "wrap things up", please:
1. Update TASK.md with completed work
2. Commit changes to Git
3. Update this CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md file
