I'm continuing work on "The BugBase" bug tracking system. The project is located at `/home/jaime/MyCode/src/BugBase/`.

## Current Status:
- Completed initial planning and project setup
- Backend fully structured with authentication system implemented
- Frontend initialized with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui
- Authentication flow complete with JWT tokens and refresh logic
- Basic layouts and routing structure in place
- Ready to implement core bug tracking features

## Tech Stack:
- Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Redis
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Infrastructure: Docker, Socket.io for real-time, JWT authentication

## Completed:
- ✅ Backend API structure with controllers, services, and middleware
