I'm continuing work on "The BugBase" bug tracking system. The project is located at `/home/jaime/MyCode/src/BugBase/`.

## Current Status:
- **TESTING COVERAGE IMPROVED** - Frontend coverage increased from 3.47% to 16.6% (378% increase!)
- Core business logic (services, key components, auth pages) at ~85%+ coverage
- 210 frontend tests passing (up from 40)
- Backend unit tests fixed and passing
- Full-stack bug tracking system with advanced features
- Real-time collaboration with Socket.io
- Complete project and user management
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities

## Tech Stack:
- Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Redis
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Real-time: Socket.io with room-based updates
- Infrastructure: Docker, JWT authentication

## Completed Features:
### Core System ✅
- ✅ Full backend implementation: auth, bugs, comments, attachments
- ✅ Bug service with CRUD, filtering, pagination, watchers
- ✅ Comment service with threading, @mentions, notifications
- ✅ File attachment service with upload/download/delete
- ✅ Complete TypeScript type system for all models

### Frontend Features ✅
- ✅ Bug management: list, detail, create, edit views
- ✅ Comment UI with nested replies and real-time updates
- ✅ File upload UI with drag & drop and progress tracking
- ✅ Dashboard with real-time bug statistics
- ✅ Reusable UI components (badges, cards, pagination)

### Advanced Features ✅
- ✅ **Project Management**: Full CRUD, member management, settings
- ✅ **User Management**: Profile with statistics, comprehensive settings
- ✅ **Advanced Search**: Full-text search, URL-persistent filters, date ranges
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Socket.io with live bug updates, comments, presence
- ✅ **Real-time Notifications**: Toast notifications for all events
- ✅ **File Attachments**: Complete upload/download system with validation

### Testing Implementation ✅
- ✅ **Backend Testing**: Jest with comprehensive mocking (Prisma, Redis, Socket.IO)
- ✅ **Frontend Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library and jsdom
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: All services, controllers, components, and utilities
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with full request/response testing
- ✅ **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows (authentication, bug management)
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Configured with HTML and lcov reporting
- ✅ **Test Automation**: Scripts for running all tests and coverage
- ✅ **Test Documentation**: Comprehensive testing guide (TESTING.md)

## Next Priority Work:
1. **Performance Optimization** - Database optimization, caching, bundle optimization  
2. **Security Hardening** - Security audit, input validation, auth review
3. **Production Deployment** - CI/CD pipeline, environment setup, monitoring
4. **Email Notifications** - Email service integration and templates
5. **Backend Integration Tests** - Fix remaining integration test failures
