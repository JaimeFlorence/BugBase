## 💡 Best Practices

### Writing Great Bug Reports

  3. Tap login button
  4. Observe nothing happens

- **Use appropriate priority levels**

#### ❌ DON'T:
- Use vague descriptions

- Set everything as "Critical"
- Forget to add relevant attachments

### Project Organization

#### Effective Labeling
- **Type**: bug, feature, enhancement, task
- **Component**: frontend, backend, database, api
- **Platform**: web, mobile, desktop
- **Release**: v1.0, v2.0, hotfix

#### Priority Guidelines
- **🔴 Critical**: System down, security issues, data loss
- **🟠 High**: Major functionality broken, affects many users
- **🟡 Medium**: Minor functionality issues, workarounds exist
- **🟢 Low**: Cosmetic issues, nice-to-have improvements

### Team Collaboration

#### Communication
- **Use @mentions** to get attention
- **Be specific** in comments
- **Update status** when starting work
- **Document decisions** in comments
- **Close bugs** when verified
